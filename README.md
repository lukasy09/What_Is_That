<h1>What is that?</h1>

<p>The project does exactly what the title says. It's trying to guess what is in the picture you pick for it.</p>

<p>The project consists of 2 layers.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Creating a Convolutional Neural Network model(in python using tf&keras libraries).</li>
	<li>Designing a web interface and converting the model to tensorflowjs standards.</li>
</ul>

<p>The application will be continuously upgraded and developed. Some new features will appear in the (near) future.</p>
<p>Below you can see how it works.</p>
